            <h3>I had already learned this with freecodecamp but these codepens offer a good reference since I will inevitably forget. When I was making my personal website I think I used flexbox where I didn't need to. the mozilla documentation for this is also great.</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>I noticed when looking through some of the finished solutions for the first website that some people were using terms I only knew about from other places, such as hero section. I was like damn these sites look great and yeah after looking at the code some of the top ones seem to be from people who already knew what they were doing a bit.</li>
            <li>it's annoying that I started with another resource so I'm tempted to skip the basic javascript stuff I already know, but I also recognize that the odin project was mostly designed to built upon its content as it goes so i don't want to risk missing anything, or worse missing lots of stuff over time without knowing it.</li> <a href="https://javascript.info/variables"><li>I did learn that capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.</li></a>
            <li>objects are not primitive data types. i knew this but didn't think of it in relation to the word primitive but it makes sense it's like blender primitive shapes.</li>
            <li>null refers to an undetermined object, undefined refers to nothing</li>
            <li>using backticks as quotes ` ` allows you to use variables in strings ${ like this }</li>
            <li>slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.</li>
            <li>substring() is similar to slice(). 

                The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring().</li>
                <li>substr() is similar to slice().

                    The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.</li>
            <li>always remember the ternary operator ( condition ) ? run this code : run this code instead</li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/reference/">good resource for chrome dev tools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/">you can use the console to run javascript on a webpage</a></li>
            <li>I do wish that half of the odin project wasn't just links to novel sized mdn documentation tho. I know it's solid but I feel like I'm still at the hand holding stage and that this is an annoying way to learn the basics when something more interactive or formatted could be used. I'm annoying. I also notice that it's easy to understand these docs since I've already learned this stuff a bit - and can see how the revision is helping still.</li>
            <li>anonymous functions allow you to pass a function as a parameter without having to define a whole other function. I'm assuming this is helpful for if it's only going to be used once since it'll keep the code cleaner. I assume if you were going to do what that function does multiple times then it would be best to just define it and call it.</li>
            <li>The arrow function is the shorthand and makes a lot more sense now. damn odin thank u.(textBox.addEventListener('keydown', event => console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`));</li>
            <li><strong>USE ARROW FUNCTIONS</strong></li>
            <li>I know i will have a long way to go even after odin but I really just want this to help me get past this beginner zone.I'm feeling frustrated having learned the same things over and over again.</li>
            <li>ngl i'm really forcing it today. relying on displine rn instead of motivation. I don't imagine this will be uncommon.</li>
            <li>some days are going to be harder than others. overall I'm committed and understand it's going to be a marathon consisting of more marathons, not a circuit. i have a lot on my mind, but know that this path will take me places that I want to go.</li>
            <li>you can define a default parameter by just using an = sign. handy to assign it to a function to execute in case that parameter isn't given. interesting functionality.</li>
            <li>must stay focused</li>
            <li>When JavaScript prepares to run the script, it first looks for global Function Declarations in it and creates the functions. We can think of it as an “initialization stage”.</li>
            <li>is the only advantage of using an arrow function for a multi line function just to avoid writing function? i guess go? unclear. couldn't seem to google it but i'm sure it'll be sorted later.</li>
            <li>“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer</li>
